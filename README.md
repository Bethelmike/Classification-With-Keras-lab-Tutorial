# Classification with Keras
Welcome to the Classification with Keras project! This repository aims to guide you through the process of implementing classification tasks using the Keras deep learning library. Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict discrete categorical labels. This project will help you understand how to set up a classification model using Keras for various applications.

# Introduction
Classification is a core concept in machine learning, and Keras simplifies the process of building and training classification models. This project focuses on demonstrating how to create a classification model using Keras, from setting up the data to training and evaluating the model's performance.
